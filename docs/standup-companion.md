# Stand-up Companion
A web application meant to help teams to organize their daily stand-up.

## What a Stand-up meeting is?

A stand-up meeting is a meeting in which attendees typically participate while standing. The discomfort of standing for 
long periods is intended to keep the meetings short.

The meeting should usually take place at the same time and place every working day. All team members are encouraged to 
attend, but the meetings are not postponed if some team members are not present. 

One of the crucial features is  that the meeting is a communication opportunity among team members and not a status update 
to management or stakeholders. 

Although it is sometimes referred to as a type of status meeting, the structure of the meeting is meant to promote 
follow-up conversation, as well as to identify issues before they become too problematic. The practice also promotes 
closer working relationships in its frequency, need for follow-up conversations and short structure, which in turn 
result in a higher rate of knowledge transfer â€“ a much more active intention than the typical status meeting. 
Team members take turns speaking, sometimes passing along a token to indicate the current person allowed to speak.

Each member talks about progress since the last stand-up, the anticipated work until the next stand-up and any 
impediments, taking the opportunity to ask for help or collaborate.
